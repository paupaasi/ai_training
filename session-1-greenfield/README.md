# Session 1: Greenfield Development with AI

**90 min | Beginner | "From Zero to Working App"**

Build a working application from scratch using AI. You'll learn tools, prompting, specs, and TDD — by building something real.

---

## Pick Your Project

Choose ONE of these three projects to build during the session:

### A) Todo CLI (Node.js/TypeScript)
A command-line todo manager with categories and priorities.
- **Feature 1:** Add a todo (with title, category, priority)
- **Feature 2:** List todos with filtering (by category, by status)
- **Folder:** `a-todo-cli/`

### B) Weather Dashboard API (Node.js/TypeScript)
A REST API that fetches, caches, and serves weather data.
- **Feature 1:** GET /weather/:city — returns current weather (from mock data)
- **Feature 2:** GET /forecast/:city — returns 5-day forecast with caching
- **Folder:** `b-weather-api/`

### C) Bookmark Manager API (Node.js/TypeScript)
A REST API for saving, tagging, and searching bookmarks.
- **Feature 1:** POST /bookmarks — create bookmark with URL validation and tags
- **Feature 2:** GET /bookmarks?tag=X — search bookmarks by tag
- **Folder:** `c-bookmark-api/`

### D) Home Psychiatrist API (Node.js/TypeScript + Gemini)
A funny retro AI psychiatrist REST API — like an 80s home computer therapy program, but powered by Gemini LLM.
- **Feature 1:** POST /sessions + POST /sessions/:id/messages — start a therapy session and chat with the psychiatrist
- **Feature 2:** GET /personalities + personality modes — switch between Freudian, new-age crystal healer, and conspiracy theorist
- **Folder:** `d-psychiatrist-api/`
